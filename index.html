                In 2003 on the first day of summer a miracle happened and I was born in Sudbury, Ontario. immediately I
                wasted no time on
                beginning my journey.

                Starting right off at my education the highschool choices I had went as far as living in a small town
                outside of the city would get
                you. With that in mind I completed my high school diploma at Chelmsford Valley District
                Composite School (CVDCS).

            <p id="p3">
                After highschool I decided to take a year off to simultaneously take time to think of what I was gonna
                pursue as well as work full time to save up some money. During this time I worked at a machine shop. At
                this shop I was
                gonna agree to an apprenticeship as I was doing great work there but, ultimately I decided to move in to
                the
                programming field.
            </p><br>
            <p id="p4">

                After I made this decision it wasn't long before I applied to attend Georgian College for programming
                and fulfill one of my many passions.
